# ‚ö°Ô∏èpiking Neural Network - A Rust Implementation ü¶Ä 

We consider (continuous-time) spiking neural networks and their use as robust memorizers of arbitrary spike trains. 
We refer to [Aguettaz and Loeliger, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01166) for details. 

The implementation is based on the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
This language was designed with several key goals, which revolve around improving safety, performance, and concurrency.

## Installation

To install Rust, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
The installation includes the Rust compiler, Cargo (the Rust package manager) and the Rust standard library.

### Building from Source 

To build the project from source, clone the repository and execute the following command in the root directory: 
```bash 
cargo build --release 
``` 
You can also generate the documentation by running: 
```bash 
cargo doc --open 
```

### Installation from crates.io

This feature will be available soon.
