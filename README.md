# ‚ö°Ô∏èpiking Neural Network - A Rust Implementation ü¶Ä 

We consider (continuous-time) spiking neural networks and their use as robust memorizers of arbitrary spike trains. 
For details, we refer to [Aguettaz and Loeliger, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01166). 

## Why Rust? 

The implementation is based on the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
This language was designed with several key goals in mind, which revolve around improving safety, performance, and concurrency[^1], while making systems programming more accessible and ergonomic.

### Memory Safety

...

### Zero-cost Abstractions

...

### Fearless Concurrency

<!-- Message passing: *"Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating."* -->
